        <b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This is a concert poster I made for my Higher Art & Design final. The breif was to create a poster advertising something. Make sure to include the place, time, date and capture the atmosphere that the event would entail. I decided to make a poster for a band called Mother Mother, an alt band. The corncert would most like be indoors at night so I tried to include the dark setting with all the bright light. To make it unique I added a silhouette of the main singer and his guitar.  <br>

        <b>DESCRIPTION:</b> Oliie is my cat that i've had 6 years. He was my first and favourite pet and we are really close i sketched up a tattoo design that i considered getting of his paw. i exerimented with different styles like realism but i didnt like that style so i went for something more cartoony with more flat colours. I also really like this design because it shows his freckle on his toe bean which is the same as a freckled i have on my finger. <br>

        <br>
        <b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This drawing is an early development of my National 5 final. The design brief was to make a travel poster to encourage tourists to visit and to include all of the stuff to expect. I decided to do Mt. Fuji during new years because this is a very popular time of year and i also chose this because of how pretty the lights would look at this time of year in the dark as this would add alot of contrast and visual impact to the piece. this was a sketch of Mt. Fuji from a city view before I implemented the new years theme i was trying out some perspective and business. this specific piece was not good as it was too busy and took the focal point away from the mountian because it was in the background. <br>
