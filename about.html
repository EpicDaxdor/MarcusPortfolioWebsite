    <h5>Marcus Lee Thomson</h5>
    <p>I am a young man with a passion for illustration and Fine Art. I am a creative person that enjoys using most types of medium both traditional and digital, to create whatever is in my imagination. It all started back in around the start of primary school. I was naturally drawn to art as a child and really just enjoyed the process, and being able to bring the ideas to life. My teachers and peers pushed and encouraged me to hone my talent, skills. At this point, i was mostly drawing whatever came to my mind and trying to "recreate" it. It kept my interest and my peers enojyed seeing my work which had me looking to learn more. As I went into high school, i started to take art seriously to possibly pursue it as a career eventually. All the knowledge I had learned only grew. Understanding new concepts and techniques as I worked with composition and perspective. Through high school, I was very limited as the SQA had very specific expectations so i could only realy work with a realistic style which wasnt my strongest and i felt as though my qualification could've had more potential. Throughout High School, some of my work was used in school competitions and won the privilage of being on the screen of a bus stop in the center of Edinburgh city for all the public to see. This was a great moral boost for me as it helped me go forward with with a more positive outlook. </p>
      
    <p>After leaving school in S6, I was accepted into Edinburgh College to do a level 6 diploma art and design course which was 1 year long. Going into the course i didn't have A big minset and was very stuck to my inital ideas but as the course progressed i leant i had to be open to new ideas and work outside my comfort zone. At the end of the course, We were told that we had 13 weeks to create a final with the skills we learnt throughout the year. Most of my work was 2D and I did one 3D piece in the middle of the year. This project was about a fungus that turns living creatures into zombies. Its a very interesting process that includes a fungus called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which you can read about <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis">here</a></u>. This topic was extremely vast and i did not cover what i wanted so i decided to return to it for my final but instead of doing it on the ants i chose to work with how it affects moths. This project was put into an art gallery for people to come a view it and give feedback which was helpful and I will try to impliament in future projects. I have recently been accepted to Glasgow Clyde college for a HND Illustration course, I am very happy about this and eager to pursue my dream. After this course i will be qualified to get a job in Concept Art. </p>

    <p>Welcome to my world of creativity. I am a passionate artist...</p>
