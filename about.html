    <h5>Marcus Lee Thomson</h5>
    <p>I am a young man  with a passion for arts and crafts. I enjoy using all types of medium to create whatever is in my imagination. I currently go to college, I study Art and Design with goal to continue forward into HND or possibly a degree. My ambitious is to become a Concept Artist. My passion started back in 2012 while I was at primary school, I enjoyed the creation process. My teachers encouraged me to learn and grow as I "showed promise". So with this encouragement I moved forward learning about artist's, styles, </p>
    <p>Welcome to my world of creativity. I am a passionate artist...</p>
