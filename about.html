    <h5>Marcus Lee Thomson</h5>
    <p>I am a young man with a passion for arts and crafts. I am an extremely creative person and I enjoy using all types of medium to create whatever is in my imagination. It all started back in 2012 while I was in primary school. I noticed that I had a talent for art and really enjoyed the process, the imagination and the creativity required to bring to life my concepts. All my teachers pushed and encouraged me to hone my talent, skills and interest. I learned so much about colours, techniques, brush strokes and diffferent styles used by many different artist's. It kept me interested and had me looking to learn more. As I went into high school, all the knowledge I had learned only grew as I learned about new concepts as I worked with shadows, sulptures, real life drawing. I had some of my work published in serveral media's including having one of my drawing's on the side of a bus stop in the center of Edinburgh city for all the public to see. It was scary as I didn't have any confidence in my ability at the time. </p>
      
    <p>After leaving school, I was accepted into Edinburgh College to do art and design. So far I have completed two years and in this time I have learned so much. At the end of the course, my final assesment was a very big and time consuming project. The project was about a fungus that turns living creatures into zombies. Its a very interesting procedure called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which you can read about <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis">here</a></u>. My project was put into an art gallery for people to come a view it and I got alot of feedback which is helpful and I will use in future projects. I have recently been accepted into the next course of my journey which is HNC, I am very happy about this and eager to pursue my dream. My ambitious is to become a Concept Artist. </p>

    <p>Welcome to my world of creativity. I am a passionate artist...</p>
