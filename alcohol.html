      <b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This was the final I made to help me achieve a higher qualification (SQA). I did this with
      acrylice paint in a very warm palette. Using warm, harmonious colours made the painting have a major visual
      impact, almost looking like a dream. I like this piece because I experimented with an artstyle that I enjoyed. I
      used a dabbing motion with an old brush and alot of paint to create this "spikey" look. I also like that with this
      style you can see the forms of the objects so you can understand what's there but theyre slightly blurred.<br>
