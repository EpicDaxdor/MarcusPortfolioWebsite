        <b>NAME OF ARTWORK:</b> Person Infected With Cordyceps (side)<br>
        <br>
        <b>DATE OF CREATION:</b> 21 / 11 / 2023 <br>
        <br>
        <b>MEDIA/STYLE:</b> Realism
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>DESCRIPTION:</b> This sculpture was a project for college where we could do anything we want as long as it was along the lines of one of these titles: rotting, growing, consumerism, etc. I went with the idea of someone being infected and slowly dying. I was also inspired by one of my favourite games 'The Last Of Us' which is about A cordycep species called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis that is made into a virus by scientist. Which then turns people into bloated zombies releasing spores wherever it walks. I love this idea of something that already existing in the world evolving into something much more lethal. I wanted to explore this process and how it would develop in a person anatomically. <br>
